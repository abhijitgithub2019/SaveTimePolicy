    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span id="date"></span></p>

    <p>
        Save Time – Focus & Block Distractions (“the extension”) helps users improve focus
        by blocking distracting websites, enforcing schedules, and protecting settings
        with optional premium features.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your privacy matters. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used,
        and how it is protected.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>a. Account Information</h3>
    <p>
        If you choose to log in using Google or email, the extension may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Display name</li>
        <li>Authentication tokens (JWT)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is used only to authenticate users, enable premium features,
        and secure access to account-based settings.
    </p>

    <h3>b. Authentication & Security Data</h3>
    <p>
        Authentication tokens are stored locally in the browser and sent securely
        to the backend when required.
    </p>
    <p>
        Passwords are never stored by the extension itself.
        All authentication handling occurs on the backend server using secure practices.
    </p>

    <h3>c. PIN and OTP Data</h3>
    <p>
        If you enable PIN-Lock features, you may create a 6-digit PIN to protect selected controls.
        PIN verification and protection rules are processed securely by the backend.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you forget your PIN, a one-time password (OTP) may be sent to your registered email
        address to verify your identity.
        OTP codes are temporary and automatically expire.
    </p>

    <h3>d. Local Extension Data</h3>
    <p>
        The extension stores configuration data locally using Chrome’s storage APIs.
        This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blocked websites and custom domains</li>
        <li>Schedule block rules</li>
        <li>Timer durations and lock states</li>
        <li>Focus sound preferences</li>
        <li>PIN protection settings</li>
        <li>Usage statistics such as time saved, streaks, and goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data remains on your device unless you choose to sync it through your account.
    </p>

    <h3>e. Error Logs and Diagnostics</h3>
    <p>
        To improve reliability and fix bugs, the extension may collect limited diagnostic data,
        including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Error messages and stack traces</li>
        <li>Timestamps</li>
        <li>Associated account email (if logged in)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Error data is batched locally and sent periodically to the backend
        for debugging purposes only.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Chrome Extension Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The extension uses Chrome extension APIs such as storage, tabs, alarms,
        notifications, and identity solely to provide its core functionality,
        including blocking websites, enforcing schedules, managing timers,
        sending reminders, and enabling secure login.
    </p>
    <p>
        These permissions are not used to access personal content beyond what is
        necessary to perform the requested features.
    </p>
    <p>
        The extension requests access to specific websites (such as social media or streaming platforms)
        only to apply user-configured blocking rules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The extension does <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read private messages</li>
        <li>Collect full browsing history</li>
        <li>Track activity on unrelated websites</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>3. Payments and Premium Features</h2>
    <p>
        The extension offers optional paid premium features.
        Payments are processed securely through third-party providers such as
        Razorpay and PayPal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The extension does not collect or store credit card, debit card,
        or banking information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment verification is handled by the backend using transaction identifiers
        provided by the payment providers.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Collected data is used only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate users</li>
        <li>Enable premium features</li>
        <li>Apply blocking rules and schedules</li>
        <li>Protect settings with PIN-Lock</li>
        <li>Process payments and subscriptions</li>
        <li>Improve stability and performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Data is never used for advertising or profiling.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is shared only with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication services (Google sign-in)</li>
        <li>Payment processors (Razorpay, PayPal)</li>
        <li>Backend services required for core functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Local data remains on your device until you remove it or uninstall the extension.
    </p>
    <p>
        Backend-stored data is retained only as long as required to provide the service
        or comply with legal obligations.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>7. User Control</h2>
    <p>
        You can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change or delete extension settings at any time</li>
        <li>Log out of your account</li>
        <li>Uninstall the extension to remove all local data</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We use standard security practices including HTTPS communication,
        token-based authentication, and controlled backend access
        to protect user data.
    </p>
